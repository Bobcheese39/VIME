simple but robust app to read h5 files with vim

vim keybinds call a python script to do certain actions
vim h5 file, opens list of available tables
vim a table, prints it to screen (tabulate)

features:
- opens a python kernel in the background 
- trigger commands that are run in the kernel using vim keybinds 
- very fast loading
- ASCII plotting w/ curses


Help me create a simple but robust application to read h5 files using vim.
 Essentially, vim keybinds call a python script to do certain actions and print tables to the screen.
  This way, loading is very fast. Some features I want to have include:
- opening a python kernel in the background, for a persistent python environment for data manipulation. 
This way data only needs to be loaded in once.
- simple TUI 
- the ability to plot data from the table in the terminal with ASCII. ideally, the use case would be something like ',plt $1 $3' -> sent to python backend for processing -> sent back to VIM and opened in new buffer.
- plots and tables open in new buffers

The script will only be run on linux.
Vim as the front end. I wouldn't mind using curses for a more aesthetic TUI, if possible, but its important that VIM is the frontend. 
python server as the backend
